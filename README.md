# Approaching to Web service Application on Network
client like chrome calls the WEB-APP(Web service Application) by url

## url
(ex)www.google.com

Generally, if human user click or insert the certain url,

then, url(or internet address) calls the function of WEB-APP

and function provides html documents which is,in other words, Front-End

I think WEB-APP can be figuratively 'Electric Vending machine' waiting for clients that canbe human or other call of web service

### url vs uri
abbr 

# communications between Front and Back of WEB-APP approached(or that you are using now)

Generally, interface of Front-end provides choices of butten that is related with other url

## RestFul
i think it can also mean 'optimized interface that can represent the sources enough' 

## Analysis of WEB-APP
WEB-APP = Front-End + Back-End

## Front-end
html + css

js(javascript)

## Back-end
API on Server like linux

DB





# Implementation of WEB-APP

besides MAJOR BASE APP like java-app,

there are many related frameworks(or tools like mybatis) that is utilized to webservice

for example, as a datamining API, django is more practical than java cuz to data analyzing libs

at this point, i will upload the related frameworks that is useful to expand webservice


## sub-tools 
like special function of DB or mybatis that is relate function or sub part of webservice
