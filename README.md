# Approaching to Web service Application on Network
client like chrome calls the WEB-APP(Web service Application) by url

## url
(ex)www.google.com

Generally, if human user click or insert the certain url,

then, url(or internet address) calls the function of WEB-APP

and function provides html documents which is,in other words, Front-End

I think WEB-APP can be figuratively 'Electric Vending machine' waiting for clients that canbe human or other call of web service

### url vs uri

at this point, i will upload the related frameworks that is useful to expand webservice


## sub-tools 
like special function of DB or mybatis that is relate function or sub part of webservice
