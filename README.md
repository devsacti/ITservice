# Approaching to Web service Application on Network
client like chrome calls the WEB-APP(Web service Application) by url

## URL
(ex)www.google.com

Generally, if human user click or insert the certain url,

then, url(or internet address) calls the function of WEB-APP

and function provides html documents which is,in other words, Front-End

I think WEB-APP can be figuratively 'Electric Vending machine'

waiting for clients that canbe human or other calls of web service

# communications between Front and Back

let's assume that you input the url and see the Front-End of WEB-APP

the Electric vending machine you encounter has functions on the 'back'

Generally, interface of Front-end provides choices of butten mappedn with other urls

so, you can access or the control the other resources of back web-service

## the related : RestFul

simplely, i think it can also mean 'optimized interface that can represent the sources enough' 

## Analysis of Front and back
WEB-APP = Front-End + Back-End

## components of Front-end
html + css

js(javascript)

! js is mapped with Url which calls the API

## components of Back-end
API on Server like linux

DB

# Implementation of WEB-APP

there are many related frameworks(or tools like mybatis) that is utilized to webservice Implementation

at this point, i will upload the related frameworks that is useful to expand webservice


## Implementations LIST
[JAVA-APP](https://github.com/devsacti/JAVA-APP)

[PYTHON-APP](https://github.com/devsacti/WEB-APP/tree/main/PYTHON-APP)
*python-app has seperate repos per prj, so this directory is only media for prj links
